Q. What happens when you initialize a repository?
 Why do you need to do it?
Ans: Git creates a repository with zero commits.
I need to do it if I want to keep commits at same
time for multiple files.
Q. How is the staging area different from
 the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Ans: The staging area is one step ahead of the
working directory but one step behind the repository.
It offers us the choice of which files we want to 
commit together.
