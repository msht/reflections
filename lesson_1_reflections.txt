Q. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?
Ans: It's really cool that
I don't have to look through thousands of lines to find
just one mistake.
Previously, I used to have to
look through literally every semi-colon
to find a mistake.
But now that I've learnt version control,
it's super easy and very useful.
Yeyyyyyyyyy!
Q. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Ans: That would be VERY helpful and super awesome!
Q. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: 	Your history won't be too cluttered.
		Every commit will be logical to you.
		You can look at a commit and know what changed here.

Cons:	You may forget to commit for a long period.
		This may result in loss of huge work.
		You'll have to spend remember to commit
		which can be stressful for some.
Q. Why do you think some version control systems,
   like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
   while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans: Because there are cases where you want to commit multiple files
at the same time because they're related. Changes in one file
affects the other.
Q. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans: git log shows all the commits with their id's and message/comment.
git diff need to be written like this: git diff previous id(the one below) new id
It shows all the changes made in colors. Green for lines added and red for
lines removed.
Q. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?
Ans: Way more confident!
Q. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Ans: For version control in all of my future apps!
