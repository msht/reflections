Q. When would you want to use a remote repository
 rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: Whenever I want to share my repository with
 co-workers or public or just friends.
Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually
 rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
  with your remote repository?
Ans: Because if I'm coding on a file and my co-worker
deletes a line that I'm working on and suddenly commits
the change and git automatically pulls it, it will be 
pretty annoying. I'm not sure if this could exactly be
a real scenario but the problems could be something like
that.
Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
 When would you use one instead of another?
 Ans: Forks for copying repositories within github.
 Clones for copying repositories within local or from github to local.
 Branches for working on a new feature inside an existing project.
