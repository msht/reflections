Q. When would you want to use a remote repository
 rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: Whenever I want to share my repository with
 co-workers or public or just friends.
Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually
 rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
  with your remote repository?
Ans: Because if I'm coding on a file and my co-worker
deletes a line that I'm working on and suddenly commits
the change and git automatically pulls it, it will be 
pretty annoying. I'm not sure if this could exactly be
a real scenario but the problems could be something like
that.
Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
 When would you use one instead of another?
 Ans: Forks for copying repositories within github.
 Clones for copying repositories within local or from github to local.
 Branches for working on a new feature inside an existing project.
Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
 remote stored locally?
Ans: I can fix the conflicts offline.
Q. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
 What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Ans: Collaborating using git and github is easy thanks to forking and
pull requests,etc. But without git or github these would be harder.
Q.When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than
 directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Ans: I would use a branch only when it is almost a must because the 
feature is too experimental or I'm working on a totally different
language,etc. Working on a branch is beneficial as I can experiment however
I want without having to worry about breaking the master.
However, making a branch for too small changes won't be a good idea as
branching requires a lot of work to keep it up to date with the master.
